## Getting Started

Instructions to get the project set up and running locally.

### Prerequisites

List any software dependencies required before installation (e.g., Node.js version, pnpm).

- Node.js (e.g., >= 18.x)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn if preferred)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  Set up environment variables:
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the required values.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    # Open .env.local and add your environment variables
    ```

## Running the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command builds the application for production usage in the `.next` folder.

## Running Tests

_(Add instructions here once a testing framework is configured)_

```bash
# Example: pnpm test
```

## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env.local` file by copying `.env.example` and filling in the necessary values. See `.env.example` for a list of required variables.

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier (TODO: Add Prettier) for code formatting.

- Run linters:
  ```bash
  # Example: pnpm lint
  ```
- Format code:
  ```bash
  # Example: pnpm format
  ```

## Deployment

Describe how to deploy the application. Often, this involves pushing to a Git provider connected to a hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.

- [Vercel Deployment Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)

## Key Technologies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- _(Add others like Tailwind CSS, testing libraries, etc., as they are configured)_
